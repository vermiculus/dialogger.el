#+Title: Dialog Transcription Support for Emacs
#+Author: Sean Allred

This package introduces basic transcription support in Emacs.
~dialogger-log~ is the basic entry point into the package, however,
~dialogger-org-log~ is added to ~org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook~ and
recognizes when it is on a log line.  If it is, it runs
~dialogger-log~.  If you're in an Org file, this provides a fluid
interface for both adding speakers and adding dialog.

Suppose point is anywhere on a line that looks like
#+BEGIN_SRC org
- [2015-03-14T10:51:18] Sean Allred :: Dialogger is pretty useful!
#+END_SRC
If you press =C-c C-c=, ~dialogger-org-log~ will recognize the line
and prompt you for a speaker as you would expect.

I recommend adding speakers as control-keys (as opposed to 'normal'
keys).  This way, you can just hold down control while you input the
sequence =c c s=, for example.  Quick and efficient logging.
